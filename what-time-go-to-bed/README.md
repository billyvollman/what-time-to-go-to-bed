## About this app

A web app that will calculate what time someone needs to go to bed based on the parameters they enter in.
* App allows users to input the following:
    - How many hours of sleep they want to get tonight
    - What activities they will perform the next morning.  For example got to gym, walk dog, make breakfast, etc
    - Users will also be asked how much time each activity will take them to complete
    - They will be asked their starting location and ending destination.

* Based on the users input the app will calculate what time the user should go to bed to get enough sleep that evening.
* The time the user needs to go to bed will then be shown on the page
* As a stretch goal to be implemented, if the user will not be able to achieve the amount of sleep they want then they will be shown a message alerting them of this and asking them to reconsider their morning to do list.
